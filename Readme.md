# Computer Graphics Programs

A collection of C++ implementations of various Computer Graphics Algorithms
The Algorithms include drawing algorithms for various primitives such as:-

## Basic Drawing Algorithms

1. Line
  1. Symmetric DDA(Digital Differential Analyser)
  2. DDA (Digital Differential Analyser)
  3. Bressenham's Algorithm

2. Circle
  1. Midpoint Algorithm

3. Ellipse
  1. Midpoint Algorithm

## Usage
The programs require libgraph library to access graphics.h headers

Compile the required program using the following command
```
g++ FirstTest.cpp -lgraph
```

This will generate an a.out file which you can run as
```
./a.out
```
